## Hi there, I'm Saba 👋
I'm an undergraduate student CS + AMS at Stony Brook University, and a Nassau Community College alumni, interested in AI/ML and data science.
Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saba-sohail-a8b19627a/)! 💬

## Recent Projects
### ⚕️ Equitable AI for Dermatology (AJL Kaggle Competition)
* During Spring AI Studio 2025 at Breakthrough Tech AI, I worked with 4 other students to create a CNN that could identify skin conditions across diverse skin colors. This project addressed the bias in the intersection between healthcare and AI, as we faced a major challenge--an imbalanced dataset with underrepresentation of patients with darker skin.
* I was responsible for exploratory data analysis (EDA), fine-tuning Keras' VGG16 Model, and exploring a custom focal loss function.

### 💉 Vaccination Rates Analysis (Pfizer)
- During Fall AI Studio 2024 at Breakthrough Tech AI, I had the pleasure of working alongside Pfizer's team of Commercial Analytics to discover drivers for vaccination rates.
- I was responsible for exploratory data analysis (EDA), including feature engineering and analysis, and experimenting with base Scikit-learn models.
